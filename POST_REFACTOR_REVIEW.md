## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **VolatilityCalculator Parameter Mismatch**
- **Issue:** Constructor expected `window` but was called with `window_days`
- **Fix:** Updated constructor parameter name to `window_days` for consistency
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 2. **Missing DCAConfig Serialization Methods**
- **Issue:** `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods missing from DCAConfig
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive serialization methods with proper validation
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. **Missing Configuration Loader Function**
- **Issue:** Test referenced `_create_default_config_file` function that didn't exist
- **Fix:** Added the missing function to support test requirements
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 4. **Enhanced Validation Logic**
- **Issue:** Configuration validation was too permissive
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive validation for private keys, amounts, and thresholds
- **Status:** ✅ Enhanced
