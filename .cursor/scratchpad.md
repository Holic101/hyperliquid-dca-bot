# Hyperliquid DCA Bot: Feature - Comprehensive Trade History

## 1. Background and Motivation

The user wants to enhance the Streamlit dashboard to display their **entire** Hyperliquid spot trading history for the connected wallet, not just the trades executed by this specific DCA bot.

This will transform the dashboard from a bot-specific monitor into a more comprehensive portfolio analysis tool, providing a complete and accurate view of all trading activity.

## 2. Key Challenges and Analysis

-   **Finding the Right API Endpoint:** The Hyperliquid Python SDK must be used to fetch the user's historical fills (trades). We need to identify the correct function (likely `info.user_fills`) and understand its parameters and the structure of the data it returns.
-   **Data Merging (Optional but ideal):** The data from the API (the "source of truth") won't include the bot-specific context we store in `dca_history.json` (e.g., the volatility at the time of the trade). A simple implementation will just show the API data. A more advanced one could merge these two data sources. For this plan, we will focus on the simple, direct implementation first: displaying the complete history from the API.
-   **UI Integration:** The new, comprehensive trade history needs to be seamlessly integrated into the existing Streamlit dashboard, replacing the current table that only shows bot-specific trades. We must ensure the data is presented clearly.

## 3. High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: API Integration & Data Fetching

1.  **Research API Method:**
    -   **Action:** Confirm that `info.user_fills` is the correct method in the Hyperliquid SDK for fetching historical trade data.
    -   **Success Criteria:** Understand the arguments required (user's wallet address) and the structure of the returned JSON data.

2.  **Implement History Fetching Function:**
    -   **Action:** Create a new asynchronous function inside the `HyperliquidDCABot` class called `async def get_account_trade_history(self)`.
    -   **Logic:** This function will call `self.info.user_fills(self.config.wallet_address)` and return the raw trade data.
    -   **Success Criteria:** The function can be called and successfully returns a list of trade objects from the API.

### Phase 2: Data Processing and UI Integration

1.  **Create Data Processing Function:**
    -   **Action:** Create a helper function that takes the raw trade data from the API and converts it into a clean Pandas DataFrame suitable for display.
    -   **Logic:** This function will select relevant columns (e.g., timestamp, ticker, side, price, quantity, fee) and format them for readability (e.g., convert timestamp, format numbers).
    -   **Success Criteria:** A DataFrame with clear, user-friendly column headers and formatted data is produced.

2.  **Update Streamlit Dashboard:**
    -   **Action:** Modify the `dashboard_page` function in `hyperliquid_dca_bot.py`.
    -   **Logic:**
        -   Remove the code that reads from `dca_history.json` for the main history display.
        -   Call the new `get_account_trade_history` function.
        -   Pass the result to the new data processing function.
        -   Display the resulting DataFrame using `st.dataframe()`.
    -   **Success Criteria:** The dashboard now displays a table with the user's complete spot trade history from Hyperliquid. The old, bot-only history table is gone.

## 4. Project Status Board

-   [x] **Phase 1.1:** Research API Method for User Fills - **COMPLETED**
-   [x] **Phase 1.2:** Implement `get_account_trade_history` Function - **COMPLETED**
-   [x] **Phase 2.1:** Implement Data Processing for API Response - **COMPLETED**
-   [x] **Phase 2.2:** Update Streamlit Dashboard with New History Table - **COMPLETED**

## 5. Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Feature implementation complete.**

-   A new function, `get_account_trade_history`, was added to the `HyperliquidDCABot` class to fetch all user fills from the Hyperliquid API.
-   The Streamlit dashboard has been updated to call this function and display a comprehensive table of all historical spot trades for the UBTC asset.
-   The old table, which only showed bot-specific trades from a local file, has been replaced.

The dashboard is now a more powerful and accurate tool for viewing trading history.

## 6. Lessons

-   The Hyperliquid SDK's `info.user_fills` method is the correct way to get a user's complete trade history.
-   When displaying data from an API, it's important to process it into a user-friendly format (e.g., converting timestamps, formatting numbers, selecting relevant columns) using a library like Pandas.
-   For a more robust user experience, it's better to fetch data from the "source of truth" (the exchange API) rather than relying solely on locally stored logs.
